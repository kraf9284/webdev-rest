                Hello! My name is Dylan Kraft and I am a student at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target=”_blank”>University 
                of St. Thomas</a> studying Computer Science. I am also minoring in Data Analytics, 
                Digital Media Art, and Film Studies. I am currently in my third year 
                of college and I have taken several computer science courses such as Algorithms, 
                Data Structures, Object Oriented Programming, and Web Development. In my spare time, 
                I enjoy art, movies, video games, and spending time with friends. I am also involved with 
                several clubs and activities on campus including my role as Marketing Chair of the Tabletop 
                Gaming Club, and member of the Computer Science and Badminton clubs.

                Hello, my name is Khalid Mohamed. I am a senior at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/" target=”_blank”>University of Saint Thomas</a>, getting a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Applied Statistics. 
                For me, computer science is a creative expression as much as it is mathematics and Algorithms. It is a opportunity for people to create something they cannot make by hand. 
                I have a strong belief that anything you go into should be done with the mindset of succeeding in it, and I fell in love with computer science because It is a thought process. 
                I am a critical problem solver and to me computer science has always been how to critically solve problems. I enjoy puzzles, video games, reading, and anything I'm able to do with friends or family. 
                I find that the most fun I have doing anything is with people who I like being around, regardless of what I'm doing. 
                I'm currently working for a company called CHS as their Queue admin and I like to think that I put everything I've learned in This job, and that includes trying to find ways to have fun no matter what the task is.
